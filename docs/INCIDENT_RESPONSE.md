### DB Connection Failure
*Symptoms: API 503, timeout errors in logs*

echo $POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING       # verify env var set
psql "$POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING"     # test connection
docker-compose restart dawar-kitchen-prod-api
curl http://localhost:8080/health

git revert HEAD && docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
